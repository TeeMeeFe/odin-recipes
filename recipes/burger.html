    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until
            well blended.
        </li>
        <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
        <li>
            Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per
            side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
            the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
